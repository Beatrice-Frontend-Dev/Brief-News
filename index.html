            The response to the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of

            Speaker Pelosi's visit to Taiwan in August sparked an unprecedented
            Chinese response, as well as highlighted the very real possibility
            of China following in Russia's footsteps and doing the unthinkable:
            invade Taiwan. Why does China want Taiwan, and how will Xi's
            increasingly Autocratic rule factor into this decision?

            Nuclear deterrence strategy as it stands today, which many believe
            has been built upon a foundation of reinforced cement, is in reality
            a house of cards; built upon the illusion of our own superiority,
            the irrationality of our actions, and the mistrust that is so deeply
            ingrained within our human psyche.
